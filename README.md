# Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Bayesian Networks

Welcome to MediMystery Labs!  
As a Data Detective, your mission is to predict the risk of heart disease using a simulated dataset of patient records. This project uses a Bayesian Network model built with the `pgmpy` library to infer health risks from variables such as age, fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, and heart rate.
